# Thoughts on Modern Web Development

The web development landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade.

## The Complexity Problem

We've gone from simple HTML/CSS/JS to:
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite, Rollup)
- Meta-frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit)
- State management libraries
- CSS-in-JS solutions

## Finding Simplicity

Despite the complexity, I'm optimistic. Tools are getting better:

- Tailwind CSS makes styling enjoyable
- Next.js App Router simplifies data fetching
- TypeScript catches errors before production

> The best code is no code at all.

What are your thoughts on the current state of web dev?
