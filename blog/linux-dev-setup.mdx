# My Linux Setup for Development

I've been using Linux as my primary development environment for over 5 years. Here's my current setup.

## Terminal Stack

- **Shell**: Fish with Starship prompt
- **Terminal**: Alacritty
- **Multiplexer**: Tmux
- **Editor**: Neovim

## Window Manager

Currently using Hyprland on Wayland. The animations are buttery smooth.

## Essential Tools

```bash
# Navigation
zoxide  # smarter cd
yazi    # terminal file manager

# System monitoring
btop    # resource monitor
```

More details coming soon!
