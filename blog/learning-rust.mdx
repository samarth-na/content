# Learning Rust in 2024

Coming from JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust was a significant paradigm shift.

## First Impressions

The borrow checker is intimidating at first. But once you understand ownership, everything clicks.

## What I Love

1. **Performance** - Zero-cost abstractions
2. **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time
3. **Tooling** - Cargo is fantastic
4. **Documentation** - docs.rs is incredible

## Current Project

Building a CLI tool to manage my dotfiles. Here's a snippet:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let home = std::env::var("HOME").unwrap();
    println!("Home directory: {}", home);
}
```

More updates as I progress!
