# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a modern blog using Next.js 14.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides excellent features out of the box:
- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- Image optimization

## Getting Started

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
```

That's it! You now have a modern blog ready to go.
