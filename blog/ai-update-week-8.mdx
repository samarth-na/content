**Qwen 3.5** (Alibaba) is a native multimodal MoE model with an innovative hybrid architecture (Gated DeltaNet + sparse MoE). Its open-weight version (Qwen3.5-397B-A17B) activates only 17B of 397B parameters per token, delivering strong reasoning, coding, and visual capabilities. The hosted "Plus" variant supports up to **1M context tokens**, making it ideal for long-document and video analysis. It excels in multilingual support (201 languages) and agentic workflows, with competitive benchmark scores across MMLU, GPQA, and SWE-Bench [[1]][[4]].

**GLM-5** (Zhipu AI) is a massive 744B-parameter MoE model (40B active) designed for complex coding and long-horizon agent tasks. It leads in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (score: 50) and supports a 200K context window. While highly capable in reasoning and STEM tasks, its API pricing is on the higher end ($1.00/$3.20 per 1M tokens for the reasoning variant) [[11]][[14]].

**MiniMax M2.5** prioritizes real-world productivity and cost efficiency. It achieves SOTA results on coding benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified (80.2%) while being dramatically cheaper—running continuously for ~$1/hour at 100 tokens/sec. Offered in two variants (standard and "Lightning"), it emphasizes fast agentic task completion with optimized token usage [[22]][[24]].

**Kimi K2.5** (Moonshot AI) is optimized for mathematical reasoning, OCR, and document understanding. With a 262K context window and ~1T parameters (32B active), it scores exceptionally high on AIME 2025 (96%) and HMMT 2025 (95%). Its pricing ($0.60/$2.50 per 1M tokens) positions it as a premium but capable option for technical and visual reasoning tasks [[29]][[36]].

**DeepSeek V3.2** stands out for extreme cost efficiency ($0.28/$0.42 per 1M tokens) while maintaining strong performance. Its 685B-parameter MoE architecture (37B active) and 128K context window deliver solid results across coding, math, and general knowledge benchmarks. It's particularly attractive for high-volume, budget-conscious deployments [[40]][[42]].
